  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> bacteria. It most often affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can affect other parts of the body. TB spreads from person to person through the air when people with pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, or spit.</p>
  <p>Globally, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. In 2022, an estimated <strong>10.6 million people</strong> fell ill with TB worldwide, and <strong>1.3 million died</strong>, including 167,000 people with HIV-associated TB.</p>
  <div class="fact">
    <strong>Key Stats (WHO 2022):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>10.6 million TB cases (6 million men, 3.4 million women, and 1.2 million children).</li>
      <li>1.3 million TB deaths (excluding HIV-positive individuals).</li>
      <li>High burden in South-East Asia (46%), Africa (23%), and Western Pacific (18%).</li>
      <li>87% of new TB cases in 30 high TB burden countries—including the Philippines.</li>
      <li>Only 7.5 million cases were officially notified in 2022, leaving a gap of over 3 million undiagnosed or unreported cases.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="spread">
  <h2>How Tuberculosis Spreads</h2>
  
  <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is primarily spread from person to person through the air. When a person with active pulmonary TB coughs, sneezes, speaks, or spits, they release infectious droplets containing <strong>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</strong> into the air. People nearby may inhale these droplets and become infected. A person only needs to inhale a small number of these germs to become infected, especially in enclosed, poorly ventilated environments.</p>

  <p>TB is most commonly spread by individuals who have active TB in the lungs or throat. People with latent TB infection (LTBI) do not spread the disease. TB does not spread through sharing utensils, shaking hands, or touching surfaces.</p>

  The risk of TB transmission increases significantly in crowded settings with poor ventilation, such as hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, refugee camps, and certain workplaces. In these environments, prolonged exposure to an infected individual increases the chance of inhaling TB bacteria.</p>

  <p>Once inhaled, TB bacteria can settle in the lungs and multiply. In many cases, the immune system successfully contains the infection, leading to latent TB, where the person is infected but asymptomatic and non-contagious. However, if the immune system weakens, the infection can progress to active TB disease, which is contagious and potentially fatal if untreated.</p>

  <p>Vulnerable populations—such as people living with HIV, those with malnutrition, smokers, people with diabetes, and individuals in poverty—are at greater risk of developing active TB after infection. Children under 5 and the elderly are also at higher risk of severe disease.</p>

  <div class="fact">
    <strong>Global TB Spread Facts (WHO 2024):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Each person with untreated active TB can infect 5–15 other people annually.</li>
      <li>TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent (above HIV/AIDS).</li>
      <li>Over 10 million people developed TB in 2022, with the majority of cases in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Treatment & Diagnosis</h2>

  <p><img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/008/327/865/non_2x/pill-bottles-and-pills-open-plastic-pills-tube-with-cap-meds-pills-lying-down-drug-medication-supplements-and-medicament-realistic-flat-style-medicine-object-illustration-vector.jpg" alt="TB medication bottles" style="float:left;max-width:200px;margin:0 20px 20px 0;border:2px solid #ccc;border-radius:8px;">
  Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical in controlling tuberculosis (TB). The process typically starts with clinical evaluation and microbiological tests to confirm <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. Common diagnostic tools include sputum smear microscopy, chest X-rays, culture, and WHO-recommended rapid molecular diagnostics like the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. These tests not only detect TB but also identify drug resistance—particularly to <strong>rifampicin</strong>.</p>

    Treatment of TB depends on whether the infection is drug-susceptible or drug-resistant. For drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), the standard regimen is 6 months of four first-line antibiotics: <strong>isoniazid</strong>, <strong>rifampicin</strong>, <strong>pyrazinamide</strong>, and <strong>ethambutol</strong>. The intensive phase (2 months) uses all four drugs, followed by a 4-month continuation phase with <strong>isoniazid</strong> and <strong>rifampicin</strong>. Proper adherence cures over 85% of cases.)</p>

  <p>For multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), WHO recommends shorter all-oral regimens (6–9 months) using newer medications such as <strong>bedaquiline</strong>, <strong>pretomanid</strong>, and <strong>linezolid</strong>. These are more tolerable and effective than older injectables. However, in 2022 only two out of five MDR/RR-TB patients accessed such treatments.</p>

  <p>Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is even more serious, requiring individualized regimens (often exceeding 20 months) with drugs like <strong>bedaquiline</strong>, <strong>linezolid</strong>, and <strong>clofazimine</strong>. Success rates are lower and side effects are more frequent.</p>

  <p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320955738/figure/tbl1/AS:669339111923721@1536594288276/WHO-recommended-doses-of-the-First-line-anti-TB-drugs.png" alt="Medication dosage chart" style="float:right;max-width:200px;margin:0 0 20px 20px;border:2px solid #ccc;border-radius:8px;">
  Treatment must be accompanied by proper case management—such as DOTS—and monitoring of side effects, liver function, sputum conversion, and weight gain. Social and nutritional support is critical, as economic hardship can affect adherence. WHO advocates for integrated care that addresses medical, emotional, and financial needs.</p>

  <p>Despite TB being curable, global challenges include limited access to diagnostics, modern drugs, and healthcare infrastructure. Strengthening public health investments and implementing WHO's End TB Strategy targets are vital in reaching elimination goals by 2035.</p>

  <div class="fact">
    <strong>Key WHO Treatment Facts (2024):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>6‑month DS‑TB success rate: ~85%.</li>
      <li>New shorter MDR‑TB regimens with <strong>bedaquiline</strong> + <strong>linezolid</strong>.</li>
      <li>Only 42% of MDR/RR‑TB cases accessed treatment in 2022.</li>
      <li>Strict adherence and monitoring are essential to prevent resistance and relapse.</li>
      <li>Support services significantly improve outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="prevention">
  <h2>Prevention</h2>

  <p>Preventing tuberculosis (TB) involves a comprehensive public health strategy aimed at reducing transmission, preventing infection from progressing to disease, and protecting vulnerable populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a combination of vaccination, preventive treatment, infection control, and social protection.</p>

  <p><img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bcg-vaccine-tuberculosis-vial-syringe-600nw-2611415895.jpg" alt="BCG vaccine for TB" style="float:right; max-width:250px; margin:0 0 20px 20px; border-radius:8px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  One of the most well-known preventive tools is the <strong>BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine</strong>. It provides partial protection, especially in children, against severe forms of TB such as TB meningitis and miliary TB. While its effectiveness varies in adults, it remains widely used in high-burden countries as part of national immunization programs.</p>

  <p>For individuals at high risk of developing TB — such as household contacts of TB patients, people living with HIV, or those with immune-compromising conditions — the WHO recommends <strong>TB preventive treatment (TPT)</strong>. TPT involves administering medications such as <strong>isoniazid</strong> and <strong>rifapentine</strong> to prevent latent TB infection from progressing into active disease. These regimens typically last 1 to 6 months, depending on the drug combination used.</p>

  <p>In healthcare and congregate settings, TB infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are essential. This includes proper ventilation, respiratory protection (e.g., N95 masks), patient triage, and education of staff and patients about cough etiquette and early diagnosis.</p>

  <p><img src="https://images.everydayhealth.com/images/news/best-masks-to-fight-omicron-1440x810.jpg?sfvrsn=f05395be_5" alt="TB patient using mask" style="float:left; max-width:250px; margin:0 20px 20px 0; border-radius:8px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  Addressing social determinants is also crucial in TB prevention. Poverty, undernutrition, overcrowding, and lack of access to healthcare are major contributors to TB risk. Programs that provide social support, housing improvements, food security, and health education play a vital role in reducing TB incidence in vulnerable communities.</p>

  <p>Finally, preventing TB requires political commitment, strong surveillance systems, and sustained investment in research to develop better vaccines and diagnostics. WHO's End TB Strategy targets a 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in TB deaths by 2035.</p>

  <div class="fact">
    <strong>Key WHO Prevention Measures (2024):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Administer the <strong>BCG vaccine</strong> to all infants in high-risk regions.</li>
      <li>Provide <strong>preventive treatment</strong> (e.g., <strong>isoniazid</strong>, <strong>rifapentine</strong>) to eligible groups.</li>
      <li>Implement <strong>infection control</strong> in hospitals and clinics.</li>
      <li>Improve <strong>living conditions</strong> to reduce airborne spread.</li>
      <li>Strengthen <strong>education and awareness</strong> in communities.</li>
